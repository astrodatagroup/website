      <description>Our group meeting is structured such that group members add slides to a shared Google slide deck with various sections and then we go through the deck as a group. One of these sections is called &amp;ldquo;feelings&amp;rdquo; and this week most of our slides were in that section. So, instead of our usual blog post, here&amp;rsquo;s a very accurate summary of our group meeting slides with &amp;lt;3 to XKCD.

      <description>This week, Rodrigo and I have been working on using our knowledge on removing instrument systematics from Kepler to better understand how to remove instrument systematics from HST. In my research I use HST’s Wide Field Camera 3 to observe transiting exoplanets in the infrared, and use the spectrum to try to identify water in the upper atmospheres of planets. This is a tall order, seeing as the signals we are looking for are &amp;lt;200ppm, and the instrument systematics can easily introduce correlated noise at the 0.</description>
