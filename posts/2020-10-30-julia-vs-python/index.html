<p>At this week&rsquo;s meeting, I asked the group for some advice about coding in <em>Julia</em> vs. in <em>Python</em>. I am starting work on a project with David Spergel and Ruth Angus, simulating the exoplanet astrometry yield from the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nancy-grace-roman-space-telescope"><em>Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</em></a>. We are going to look at synergies between <em>Roman</em> exoplanet astrometry and radial velocity (RV) observations from the <a href="http://www.terrahunting.org/">Terra Hunting Experiment</a>. In order to simulate the joint RV and astrometry signals, we are planning on using <a href="https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/stable/">exoplanet</a> or <a href="https://github.com/adrn/thejoker">The Joker</a> as well as some other exclusively <em>Python</em> packages. So, I asked for advice on whether it would still be &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; in terms of computational speed to write the code in <em>Julia</em> if the code I am writing will be primarily a wrapper for other <em>Python</em> packages. In addition, I was curious whether calling <em>Python</em> packages in <em>Julia</em> (using PyCall) would introduce a slowdown in the code.</p>
<p>Eric Ford said that there is no speed penalty in using PyCall in order to run <em>Python</em> packages in <em>Julia</em>. He also mentioned that <em>Python</em> actually works quite well as a scripting language, so if I will primarily be calling <em>Python</em> packages for the meat of the code, then it would work well to do so in <em>Python</em>. The conversation then turned into a deeper discussion about the possible benefits/downsides of re-implementing the existing <em>Python</em> packages in <em>Julia</em>. Dan Foreman-Mackey suggested that the codes themselves are quite replicable and it wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to re-implement them in <em>Julia</em>. David Hogg brought up the benefit in writing my own code from scratch in terms of developing a deeper understanding of how the code works. He also suggested for me to &ldquo;think about your goals and do what makes sense within those goals.&rdquo; Megan Bedell and Adrian Price-Whelan then suggested an alternative approach could be to implement a few toy or simpler cases to get a feel for what&rsquo;s going on, but ultimately using existing packages in production work. Dan Foreman-Mackey also mentioned that the <em>Julia</em> code wouldn&rsquo;t be quicker than the existing <em>Python</em> packages, as these packages use C or C++ for the computationally expensive portions of the code.</p>
<p>The main takeaway I got from the conversation is that it would be possible to do the project in <em>Julia</em>, by re-writing the <em>Python</em> packages that I would need, but that this is only really the right approach if it is something that I am specifically interested in doing as a project in itself. Otherwise, if the primary goal is to quickly produce a functioning simulation of <em>Roman</em> astrometry + Terra Hunting RVs, then it is likely better to use the existing <em>Python</em> code bases and to write the wrapping/scripting code in <em>Python</em> as well.</p>
